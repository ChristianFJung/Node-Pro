# Project 1

The goal of project 1 is to have you and your team answer real life data science questions and share your findings.  These projects are intentionally vague, we want you to dive deep into the data and figure out the important questions yourself. Each team will be randomly assigned one of the following project topics. 

You will be given time to work on the project with your team during Lab, but you will also need to meet *(virtually or in person)* with your team outside of lab to accomplish the task. 



*These projects are fictional projects using real data. However if you would like to go the extra mile, you are more than welcome to contact people you think could benefit from these projects.*



## Deliverable

The deliverable will be a google slides presentation, you also must submit the corresponding notebooks to show your work.

Presentation tips available [here](/help/presentationtips).

## Projects Available 



### Paycheck Protection Plan Data- Charlottesville 

[Data](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data)

Your job is to provide analysis on the paycheck protection plan data for the Charlottesville area. I'm curious to know the extent of loans provided in Cville and how they differ from the rest of Virginia.  *(Note: you most include data on loans under 150,000 and over: separate files)* 

I do not know a lot about this problem so it is up to you to include what you think is important. However, it might be interesting to see the percentage of loans gone to minority owned business  and if any of the Universities are included in the data. 







### NYPD Hate Crime Database

[Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/hate-crimes.page)



NYPD's hate crime database is quite frankly a mess! They have separate spreadsheets for each quarter but there is no analysis indicating how hate crimes have changed over time. Your job is to help summarize this data for a local non-profit so they know how they can adequately address the problem. Keep in mind that you want to be tracking both complaints and arrests. If complaints are going down, that might not be a good thing. 





### Help UVA Safety Ambassadors Determine Where to Patrol

UVA has a finite amount of [safety ambassadors](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/), and we want to make sure that they are positioned in a place that could most adequately use it. Your job is to use [Charlottesville crime data](https://opendata.charlottesville.org/datasets/d1877e350fad45d192d233d2b2600156_6) to determine where it makes the most sense to position the ambassadors. You are welcome to utilize their [coverage map](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/sites/ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/files/AmbassadorMap2018.pdf) or their own [reporting](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/ambassador-highlights). *Feel free to go down to the safety office and ask if they have any more information.*
