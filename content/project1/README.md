# Project 1

The goal of project 1 is to have you and your team answer real life data science questions and share your findings.  These projects are intentionally vague, we want you to dive deep into the data and figure out the important questions yourself. Each team will be randomly assigned one of the following project topics. 

You will be given time to work on the project with your team during Lab, but you will also need to meet *(virtually or in person)* with your team outside of lab to accomplish the task. 



*These projects are fictional projects using real data. However if you would like to go the extra mile, you are more than welcome to contact people you think could benefit from these projects.*



## Deliverable

The deliverable will be a google slides presentation, you also must submit the corresponding notebooks to show your work.

Presentation tips available [here](/help/presentationtips).

## Projects Available 



### Paycheck Protection Plan Data- Charlottesville 

[Data](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data)

Your job is to provide analysis on the paycheck protection plan data for the Charlottesville area. I'm curious to know the extent of loans provided in Cville and how they differ from the rest of Virginia.  *(Note: you most include data on loans under 150,000 and over: separate files)* 

I do not know a lot about this problem so it is up to you to include what you think is important. However, it might be interesting to see the percentage of loans gone to minority owned business  and if any of the Universities are included in the data. 

### Paycheck Protection Plan Data- Largest Plans 

[Data](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data)

Your assignment is to look at the largest plans in the paycheck protection plan data and see if there is anything in common between them.  You have the freedom to combine this data with other sources if you'd like. *Potential ways of tackling the problem - Are these located specifically in center areas? Are they public or private? Does more employees necessarily mean they were given more money?*





### NYPD Hate Crime Database

[Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/hate-crimes.page)



NYPD's hate crime database is quite frankly a mess! They have separate spreadsheets for each quarter but there is no analysis indicating how hate crimes have changed over time. Your job is to help summarize this data for a local non-profit so they know how they can adequately address the problem. Keep in mind that you want to be tracking both complaints and arrests. If complaints are going down, that might not be a good thing. 





### Help UVA Safety Ambassadors Determine Where to Patrol

UVA has a finite amount of [safety ambassadors](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/), and we want to make sure that they are positioned in a place that could most adequately use it. Your job is to use [Charlottesville crime data](https://opendata.charlottesville.org/datasets/d1877e350fad45d192d233d2b2600156_6) to determine where it makes the most sense to position the ambassadors. You are welcome to utilize their [coverage map](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/sites/ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/files/AmbassadorMap2018.pdf) or their own [reporting](https://ambassadors.uvapolice.virginia.edu/ambassador-highlights). *Feel free to go down to the safety office and ask if they have any more information.*



### School Shootings and Mental Health Facilities

*This project is really a data synthesis task- combing data from two different places.*



I'm curious to know if locations where school shootings occur have a lower number of mental health facilities than the national average. Your job is to determine if there is any  difference of the number of facilities between places where there is school shootings and places where there is not. 

*Below is two datasets that I've given to help complete this task but you are welcome to choose another.*



[Mental Health Data *(Click delimited)*](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-mental-health-services-survey-2019-n-mhss-2019-ds0001-nid18959)

[School Shooting Data](https://www.kaggle.com/ecodan/school-shootings-us-1990present/data)



### Confederate Monuments

For this project, you will provide analysis for the confederate statues that have been moved. You will use [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W4H2qa2THM1ni53QYZftGob_k_Bf9HreFAtCERfjCIU/edit?pli=1#gid=1205021846) from the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy#Download%20the%20data).  *I ask that you primarily use the tab "Whose Heritage Master."* Feel free to ask questions like which figures had their statues removed or who sponsored the most taken down? 

If you'd like to go the extra mile, an interesting approach might be to compare how many statues were removed throughout the past few years and see if you can correlate it with press *[(google trends)](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US)*.



*[Criticism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2018/11/08/feature/is-the-southern-poverty-law-center-judging-hate-fairly/) of SPLC's methods that you should be aware of*
