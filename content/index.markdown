#Welcome to Node Pro! 



This course is designed to take your data science skills to the next level and help you begin to engage with the data science community. We assume that you have had some exposure to data science and some exposure  to python. There is no need to be an expert or be a CS God to take this class. 



The class will be structured as 3 main units and each unit will culminate in a project where you will use your skills in a real life application. Throughout all units, we will be working to engage and learn from real life data scientists and help you to establish your own place in this community. 

The units are as follows:

* **Unit 1** *(Week 1-3):*  Data, Data,Data!
  	- This unit will review the concepts of data discovery, manipulation, and analysis. 
  	- APIs will be introduced as a way of gathering data.
* **Unit 2**     *(Week 4-6)*:  Goodbye World. Hello Machine Learning!
  	* What is ML and why do we care about it?
  	* Understanding a broad overview about ML and when it is used?
* **Unit 3** *(Week 7-9):* Journey into Deep Learning
  	* A brief introduction to the world of NLP and Image Classification

The following topics will be interspaced throughout the Units:

* DevOPs
* Data Ethics





## Class Organization

Node Pro will be centered around one 2hr workshop each week on Zoom. In addition, we will have <u>Offsite Labs</u> each week. These labs will be 30-45 minutes and will either be on zoom or at another building on grounds.

I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science, interested in the intersection of data and people. I  currently work part time with the Novetta Machine Learning Center of Excellence where my work primarily focuses on developing new methods for text interpretability. Outside of my work at Novetta, I also volunteer with the U.S. Air Force through the X-Force program and am the technical producer for the Global Inquirer podcast.



I took Node the first semester of my first year and have been involved with HackCville ever since. I was a PC, then I taught Node for two semesters and I'm incredibly excited to have created this class, Node Pro, from scratch and share it with all of you!!



On a personal note, I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, I love to run, scuba dive, and volunteer with children in STEM!
