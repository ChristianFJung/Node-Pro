#Welcome to Node Pro! 



This course is designed to take your data science skills to the next level and help you begin to engage with the data science community. We assume that you have had some exposure to data science and some exposure  to python. There is no need to be an expert or be a CS God to take this class. 



The class will be structured as 3 main units and each unit will culminate in a project where you will use your skills in a real life application. Throughout all units, we will be working to engage and learn from real life data scientists and help you to establish your own place in this community. 

The units are as follows:

* **Unit 1** *(Week 1-3):*  Data, Data,Data!
  	- This unit will review the concepts of data discovery, manipulation, and analysis. 
  	- APIs will be introduced as a way of gathering data.
* **Unit 2**     *(Week 4-6)*:  Goodbye World. Hello Machine Learning!
  	* What is ML and why do we care about it?
  	* Understanding a broad overview about ML and when it is used?
* **Unit 3** *(Week 7-9):* Journey into Deep Learning
  	* A brief introduction to the world of NLP and Image Classification

The following topics will be interspaced throughout the Units:

* DevOPs
* Data Ethics
