    "What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are a great way for your program to interface with other applications to get data <br>\n",
    "- APIs aren't some magical thing that all websites have. The developers of every website may or may not choose to build and maintain an API that the public can use. <br>\n",
    "- Many popular sites have APIs! Not only is it easier to transfer than say a physical file download, but any updates to the dataset can be accessed directly by the code. <br>\n",
    "- APIs are absolutely essential to know if you are interested in web development or working with web data."
