# HW 2 - Joining the Data Science Community

For homework this week, I want to help you all begin to enter the data science community online. I remember when I first got started I was really overwhelmed with the number of resources and things to read. Each week from here forward, I'm going to try and highlight some ways for you to engage with the community. 



To start, I would like everyone to either create a  twitter for data science  or create a data science list.  To make it incredibly easy for you, I've created a [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295118685036666880?s=20) that allows you to see what my timeline is like. *(Shown below)*





Next, I'd like you to take a look at [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Obviously the name is incredibly cheesy but there is a lot of good content! I find some articles to be incredibly over my head but other stuff can be quite cool and data-y. 





## Deliverables

1. Share a link in the slack channel  to an article that you've found on hacker news that interests you.
2.  Reply to a  cool data related tweet and tag me [@ChristianFJung](https://twitter.com/christianfjung).
