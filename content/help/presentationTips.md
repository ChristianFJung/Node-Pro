# How to Make Good Presentations

**#1 Tip** to make a beautiful presentation,   save figures transparently in [matplolib](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15857647/how-to-export-plots-from-matplotlib-with-transparent-background) and seaborn . 

* *For certain libraries, you can skip this work and do `File-> Download As- > Markdown`which will give you a zip with all your pictures stored.* 







## Christian's presentation resources

* Great templates at [slidescarnival.com](http://slidescarnival.com) or [slidesgo.com](http://slidesgo.com)
* Use [https://carbon.now.sh/](https://carbon.now.sh/) for great code snippets
* When pasting graphs in Google slides, click on an image than `format options -> recolor`
  * Have your graphs match the template. 
* Checkout an example that I made for  a class that looks really good ->  [Boston Housing Data Example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSbjOaXGjkEDSPZTjVj79CjyDIiR7e9yyEC_YwiJW513Qz6zDsXCbHlzMvW98e2VWHhRE05FsBEe-g6/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
  * To me this is the best of both worlds, looks very clean but I'm not spending tons of time making a beautiful deck. 

## Presentation Guides

These are from HackCville's digital marketing class and are great resources.
