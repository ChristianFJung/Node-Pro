## Lab

Welcome to the world of ethically dubious big data!! 



This data is from a company called SafeGraph and they pay mobile apps for your location data so that they can track people and sell it to retailers. Since we're students, we can get access to some of their data for COVID analysis but I want you to think  what someone malicious could do with all this information.



In order to use their data, you need to sign up. Once you have accesss, you get 100s of GBs of data that have people's location. In order to save the memory of your computer, I have subsetted out all the data for UVA and Cville. 





For this lab, I'm going to walk you through how I would try and piece together some quick analysis.
