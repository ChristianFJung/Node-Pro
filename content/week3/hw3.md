#  HW 3 - Reflection Assignment

*Two quick things and 1 article to read and reflect on*

1. First, complete this quick feedback survey and share your opinion on the project, the class so far, and your teammates. 
2. Share a link to cool DS related tweet or article in the Slack Channel. *(See [HW2](../week2/hw2.md) for a refresher)*
3. Read this [article](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/what-is-data-science/), and reflect on your experience in data science throughout your college career. This can be heavily stream of conscience, I'm just curious to know what lead you into data science and why your interested in continuing to study it. *(Submit response [here](https://forms.gle/4Rschc63o4rXSbpT9))*
