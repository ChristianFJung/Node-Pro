# Project 3

The goal of this project is to combine the work from our first two projects. 



Using the model that you explored in mini project 2, use it to create an impactful project idea. *(If you find a dataset that you are really interested in but think your model doesn't make sense talk to Christian)*



**Projects will be Sunday November 15th**

Scheduled Work time:

* 1 hr Sunday Nov 1st
* 45 min lab week of Nov 2nd
* 1 hr Sunday Nov 8th
* 45 min lab week of Nov 9th

*I recommend scheduling at least 1 more work time.*





## Deliverables

* A Powerpoint deck 
  	* Include how the model works, what you attempted to do, how'd it work, and if there is any ethical considerations
* Something else publishable *(suggestions)*:
