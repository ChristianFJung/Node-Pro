# HW 1

For "homework" this week, you just need to do two quick things. 

1. Fill out this survey. *(Used to help make project groups and potentially used as a dataset in the future)*
2. Sign for an account on [Github](https://github.com/) and then sign up for the [GitHub student developer pack.](https://education.github.com/pack)  



*Reminder there is no lab this week.*
