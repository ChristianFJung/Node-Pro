For "homework" this week, you just need to do two quick things. 

1. Fill out this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsIbREvS9UiyoOHnUAq_9VkqXs9WukBChdGGiMVKBw7LWsgw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1773854676=Yes). *(Used to help make project groups and potentially used as a dataset in the future)* **DUE FRIDAY at Noon**
2. Sign for an account on [Github](https://github.com/) and then sign up for the [GitHub student developer pack.](https://education.github.com/pack)  



*Reminder there is no lab this week.*
